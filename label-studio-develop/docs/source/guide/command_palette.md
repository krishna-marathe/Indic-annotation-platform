From here you can:

- Search across your Label Studio org. For example, you can search for projects and workspaces.
- Navigate to pages within the app. 
- Find quick links to Label Studio documentation and resources, such as the API docs and the changelog. 
- When you are in a project, you can search for settings pages or individual settings to quickly jump to them. 

## Role-aware results 

Results respect your role and access. For example, Annotators and Reviewers won’t see workspaces or projects that they can’t access.

## AI assistant

If AI assistant is enabled, you can enter a query and then press Tab. The assistant opens automatically with your query.

- Use the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to navigate through the results
