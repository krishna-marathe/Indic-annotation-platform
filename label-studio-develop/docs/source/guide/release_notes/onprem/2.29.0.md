## Label Studio Enterprise 2.29.0

<div class="onprem-highlight">New Chat tag, Azure Blob Storage with Service Principal authentication, filtering enhancements, improved UX</div>

*Sep 26, 2025*

Helm Chart version: [1.11.2](https://github.com/HumanSignal/charts/blob/master/heartex/label-studio/Chart.yaml)

### New features

#### Annotate conversations with a new Chat tag

Chat conversations are now a native data type in Label Studio, so you can annotate, automate, and measure like you already do for images, video, audio, and text.

For more information, see:

[**Chat tag page**](/tags/chat.html)

[**Chat labeling templates**](/templates/gallery_chat)

### Enhancements

#### One-click annotation for audio-text dialogues

When labeling paragraphs in dialogue format (`layout="dialogue"`), you can now apply labels at an utterance level.

There is a new button that you can click to apply the selected label to the entire utterance. You can also use the pre-configured `Command + Shift + A` hotkey:

#### Adjustable height for audio players

While you can still adjust the default height in the labeling configuration, now users can drag and drop to adjust the height as needed.

#### Support for Azure Blob Storage with Service Principal authentication

You can now connect your projects to Azure Blob Storage using Service Principal authentication.

Service Principal authentication uses Entra ID to authenticate applications rather than account keys, allowing you to grant specific permissions and can be easily revoked or rotated. For more information, see [Azure Blob Storage with Service Principal authentication](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/storage#Azure-Blob-Storage-with-Service-Principal-authentication).

#### Redesigned cloud storage modal

When adding cloud storage, the modal has now been redesigned to add clarity and additional guidance to the process.

For example, you can now preview a list of files that will be imported in order to verify your settings.

<img style="max-width: 800px" src="/images/releases/2-29-cloud-storage-modal.png" alt="Screenshot"/>


#### Debug custom agreement metrics

There is a new **See Logs** option for [custom agreement metrics](custom_metric), which you can use to view log history and error messages.

<img style="max-width: 500px" src="/images/releases/2-29-debug-metrics.png" alt="Screenshot"/>

#### Nested annotator filter

When applying an annotation results filter, you will now see a nested Annotator option. This allows you to specify that the preceding filter should be related to the specific annotator.

For example, the following filter will retrieve any tasks that have an annotation with choice "bird" selected, and also retrieve any tasks that have an annotation submitted by "Sally Opossum."

This means if you have a task where "Max Opossum" and "Sally Opossum" both submitted annotations, but only Max chose "bird", the task would be returned in your filter.

With the new nested filter, you can specify that you only want tasks in which "Sally Opossum" selected "bird":

#### Filter by prediction results

You can now filter prediction results by selecting options that correspond to control tag values.

Previously, you could only filter using an unstructured text search.

The prediction results filter also includes a nested model version filter, which (if specified) will ensure that your filters returns tasks only when the selected prediction result comes from the selected model.

#### Hide Data Manager columns from users

There is a new project setting available from **Annotation > Annotating Options** and **Review > Reviewing Options** called **Show unused data columns to reviewers in the Data Manager**.

This setting allows you to hide unused Data Manager columns from any Annotator or Reviewer who also has permission to view the Data Manager.

"Unused" Data Manager columns are columns that contain data that is not being used in the labeling configuration.

For example, you may include meta or system data that you want to view as part of a project, but you don't necessarily want to expose that data to Annotators and Reviewers.

<img style="max-width: 600px" src="/images/releases/2-29-dm-columns.png" alt="Screenshot"/>

#### Manager and Reviewer access to the Annotator Dashboard

Managers and Reviewers will now see a link to the Annotator Dashboard from the Home page.

The [**Annotator Dashboard**](dashboard_annotator) displays information about their annotation history.

**Managers:**

**Reviewers:**

#### Show models in the Members dashboard

If your project is using predictions, you will now see a **Show Models** toggle on the [Members dashboard](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/dashboard_members).

This will allow you to view model agreement as compared to annotators, other models, and ground truths.

#### Set model provider API keys for an organization

There is a new **Model Providers** page available at the organization level where you can configure API keys to use with LLM tasks.

If you have previously set up model providers as part of your Prompts workflow, they are automatically included in the list.

For more information, see [Model provider API keys for organizations](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/model_providers).

#### Improved UX on the Organization page

The Organization page (only accessible to Owner and Admin roles) has been redesigned to be more consistent with the rest of the app.

Note that as part of this change, the [**Access Token**](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/access_tokens) page has been moved under **Settings**.

**Before:**

**After:**

#### New email notification option for users who are not activated

Administrators and Owners can now opt in to get an email notification when a new user logs in who has not yet been assigned a role.

Like all email preferences, this can be disabled and hidden for the whole organization on the **Organization > Usage and License** page.

#### Apply labels from multiple `<Labels>` controls

When you have a labeling configuration that includes multiple `<Labels>` blocks, like the following:

```xml
<View>
<Text name="text" value="$text" granularity="word"/>
<Labels name="category" toName="text" choice="single">
  <Label value="Animal" background="red"/>
  <Label value="Plant" background="darkorange"/>
</Labels>
<Labels name="type" toName="text" choice="single">
  <Label value="Mammal" background="green"/>
  <Label value="Reptile" background="gray"/>
  <Label value="Bird" background="blue"/>
</Labels>
</View>
```

You can now choose multiple labels to apply to the selected region.

#### Multiple SDK enhancements

We have continued to add new endpoints to our SDK. See our [**SDK releases**](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio-sdk/releases).

#### Miscellaneous UX improvements

- Various improvements to the list view for the Projects page.

- Improvements to sorting and buttons for the grid view of the Projects page.

- Each user has a numeric ID that you can use in automated workflows. These IDs are now easier to quickly find through the UI.

    You can find them listed on the **Organization** page and in the **Annotation Summary** table on the **Members** page for projects.

- When loading the Data Manager in which you have not yet imported data, you will now see a more helpful interface.

- When duplicating a project, you will now see a modal with an updated UI and more helpful text.

#### Performance improvements and optimizations

Multiple performance optimizations, fine-tuning, and dependency cleanup.
