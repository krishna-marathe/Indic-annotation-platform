## Label Studio Enterprise 2.32.0

<div class="onprem-highlight">Support reports, granular permission options, new command palette</div>

*Jan 14, 2026*

Helm Chart version: [1.11.7](https://github.com/HumanSignal/charts/blob/master/heartex/label-studio/Chart.yaml)

### New features

#### Support reports

There is a new option under **Organization > Settings** to create Support Reports. 

A Support Report is a downloadable file with diagnostic and usage statistics generated from your Label Studio Enterprise deployment. 

These reports can help our support engineer diagnose issues, but are also transparent - meaning you can inspect their contents before sharing. 

For more information, see [Support reports](support_reports).

#### Refine permissions

There is a new page available from **Organization > Settings > Permissions** that allows users in the Owner role to refine permissions across the organization.

This page is only visible to users in the Owner role.

For more information, see [Customize organization permissions](admin_permissions).

#### Command palette for enhanced searching

The command palette is an enhanced search tool that you can use to navigate to resources both inside and outside the app, find workspaces and projects, and (if used within a project) navigate to project settings.

For more information, see [Command palette](command_palette).

### Feature updates

#### Annotator evaluation enhancements

The [Annotator Evaluation](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/project_settings_lse#annotator-eval) feature been improved to include a more robust ongoing evaluation functionality and improved clarity within the UI.

Enhancements include:

- An improved UI to make it clearer what will happen based on your selections.
- Previously if you were using "ongoing" evaluation mode, ground truth tasks were restricted by whatever [overlap](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/project_settings_lse#overlap) you configured for your project. This meant that typically only the first annotators to reach the ground truth tasks were evaluated.Now, if annotator evaluation is enabled, all annotators will be evaluated against ground truth tasks regardless of whether the overlap threshold has been reached. This will ensure that even if the project has a large number of annotators and a comparatively small annotation-per-task requirement, all annotators will still be evaluated.
- You can now set up your project so that annotator evaluation happens both at the beginning of the project as well as on an ongoing basis. Previously, you could only choose one or the other.

**After:**

<img src="/images/releases/2-32-ann-eval-after.png" style="max-width: 500px" alt="Screenshot">

!!! info Tip
    You can disallow skipping in all project tasks. But if you want to allow skipping while ensuring that annotators cannot skip ground truth tasks, you can use the new unskippable task feature described below. 

#### Task summary improvements

We have made a number of improvements to task summaries.

**Before:**

**After:**

<img src="/images/releases/2-32-task-summary-after.png" style="max-width: 500px" alt="Screenshot">

Improvements include:

- **Label Distribution** 
A new **Distribution** row provides aggregate information. Depending on the tag type, this could be an average, a count, or other distribution.
- **Updated styling**
Multiple UI elements have been updated and improved, including banded rows and sticky columns. You can also now see full usernames.
- **Autoselect the comparison view**
If you are looking at the comparison view and move to the next task, the comparison view will be automatically selected.

#### Improved annotation tabs

Annotation tabs have the following improvements:

- To improve readability, removed the annotation ID from the tab and truncated long model or prompts project names.
- Added three new options to the overflow menu for the annotation tab:
    - **Copy Annotation ID** - To copy the annotation ID that previously appeared in the tab
    - **Open Performance Dashboard** - Open the Member Performance Dashboard with the user and project pre-selected.
    - **Show Other Annotations** Open the task summary view.

#### Unskippable tasks

While you can hide the **Skip** action in the [project settings](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/project_settings_lse#Annotation), this enhancement allows you to configure individual tasks so that any user in the Annotator or Reviewer role should not be able to skip them.

To make a task unskippable, you must specify `"allow_skip": false` as part of the JSON task definition that you import to your project.

For example, the following JSON snippet would result in one skippable task and one unskippable task:

```json
[
  {
    "data": {
      "text": "Demo text 1"
    },
    "allow_skip": false
  },
  {
    "data": {
      "text": "Demo text 2"
    }
  }
]
```
For more information, see [Skipping tasks](skip).

#### Apply overlap only to distinct users

When configuring [**Annotations per task**](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/project_settings_lse#overlap) for a project, only annotations from distinct users will count towards task overlap.

Previously, if a project had **Annotations per task** set to 2, and User A created and then submitted two annotations on a single task (which can be done in Quick View), then the task would be considered completed.

Now, the task would not be completed until a different user submitted an annotation.

#### Improved Local Storage setup process

The Local Storage setup process has a number of improvements. 

Changes include:

- When entering the absolute local path in the storage modal, trailing slashes will be automatically removed to prevent an error.
- Normalized slashes when saving the absolute local path to prevent confusion between Unix and Windows environments.
- If you create folders named "my-data" or "label-studio-data" and run the label-studio command in the parent directory, the `LOCAL_FILES_DOCUMENT_ROOT` and `LOCAL_FILES_SERVING_ENABLED` variables will be automatically set to point to those folders. 
- Improved error messages when the absolute local path does not include a subdirectory but matched the local files document root.
- When the local files document root is set, the absolute local path is automatically preloaded with the appropriate path.

#### Support for GPT-5.1 and GPT-5.2

When you add OpenAI models to Prompts or to the organization model provider list, GPT-5.1 and GPT-5.2 will now be included.

#### Additional functional and usability enhancements

- When configuring SAML, you can now click on a selection of common IdPs to pre-fill values with presets.

- The **Recent Projects** list on the Home page will now include the most recently visited projects at the top of the list instead of pinned projects.

- Removed the **Publish** button from the project Members page. It is now only on the Dashboard page.

- When [using the API](https://api.labelstud.io/api-reference/api-reference/projects/members/bulk/post#request.query) to bulk assign and unassign users, you can now filter by last activity and role.

- To better utilize space, the annotation ID and the navigation controls for the labeling stream have been moved to below the labeling interface.
