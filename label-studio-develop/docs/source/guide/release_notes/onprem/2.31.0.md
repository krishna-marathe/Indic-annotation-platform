## Label Studio Enterprise 2.31.0

<div class="onprem-highlight">Inline OCR labeling for PDFs, Markdown tag, better visibility into agreement and member performance</div>

*Dec 03, 2025*

Helm Chart version: [1.11.6](https://github.com/HumanSignal/charts/blob/master/heartex/label-studio/Chart.yaml)

### New features

#### Inline OCR labeling in PDF files

You can now perform page-level annotation on PDF files by highlighting OCR regions.

This new functionality also supports displaying PDFs natively within the labeling interface, allowing you to zoom and rotate pages as needed.

For more information, see the [PDF tag documentation](/tags/pdf) and [Blog - Inline PDF Labeling in Label Studio Enterprise for OCR](https://humansignal.com/blog/inline-pdf-labeling-in-label-studio-enterprise-for-ocr/).

#### New Markdown tag

There is a [new Markdown tag,](/tags/markdown) which you can use to add content to your labeling interface.

For example, adding the following to your labeling interface:

```xml
<View>
<Markdown>
## Heading 2
    
### Heading 3
    
- bullet point one
- bullet point two
    
**Bold text** and *italic text*
    
`inline code`
    
\```
code block
\```

</Markdown>
</View>
```

#### New Agreement (Selected) column

There is a new **Agreement (Selected)** column that allows you to view agreement data between selected annotators, models, and ground truths.

This is different than the **Agreement** column, which displays the average agreement score between all annotators.

Also note that now when you click on a comparison between annotators in the [**agreement matrix**](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/dashboard_members#Annotator-Agreement-Matrix), you will be taken to the Data Manager with the **Agreement (Selected**) column pre-filtered for those annotators and/or models.

For more information, see [**Agreement and Agreement (Selected) columns**](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/manage_data#Agreement-and-Agreement-Selected-columns).

#### New Analytics navigation and improved performance dashboard

The Member Performance dashboard has been moved to a location under Analytics in the navigation menu. This page now also features an improved UI and more robust information about annotating and reviewing activities, including:

- Consolidated and streamlined data
- Additional per-user metrics about reviewing and annotating activity
- Clearer UI guidance through tooltips
- Easier access through a new Analytics option in the navigation menu

For more information, see [Member Performance Dashboard](dashboard_annotator).

#### Additional chat improvements

- Fixed an issue where Tool calls appeared as User calls in the chat UI.

- Chat messages that reference files stored in cloud storage (S3, Azure, GCS, Dropbox) are now automatically converted to accessible presigned URLs, allowing users to view or download files without permission errors.

- Chat templates are now available in the in-app chat gallery.

#### Improved project quality settings

The [**Quality section**](https://docs.humansignal.com/guide/project_settings_lse#Quality) of the project settings has been improved.

- Clearer text and setting names
- Settings that are not applicable are now hidden unless enabled

#### Additional validation when performing destructive actions in projects

When deleting a project, resetting the project cache, or dropping all project tabs, users will now be asked to enter text in the confirmation window:

#### Improved project onboarding checklist

The onboarding checklist for projects has been improved to make it clearer which steps still need to be taken before annotators can begin working on a project:

#### Agreement calculation change

When calculating agreement, control tags that are not populated in each annotation will now count as agreement.

Previously, agreement only considered control tags that were present in the annotation results. Going forward, all visible control tags in the labeling configuration are taken into consideration.

For example, the following result set would previously be considered 0% agreement between the two annotators, as only choices group 1 would be included in the agreement calculation.

Now it would be considered 50% agreement (choices group 1 has 0% agreement, and choices group 2 has 100% agreement).

**Annotator 1**

Choices group 1

A ✅

B ⬜️

Choices group 2

X ⬜️

Y ⬜️

**Annotator 2**

Choices group 1

A ⬜️

B ✅

Choices group 2

X ⬜️

Y ⬜️

!!! note

    This change only applies to new projects created after November 13th, 2025.

    Only visible tags are taken into consideration. For example, you may have tags that are conditional and hidden unless certain other tags are selected. These are not included in agreement calculations as long as they remain hidden.


#### Personal Access Token support for ML backends

Previously, if using a [machine learning model](ml) with a project, you had to set up your [ML backend](https://github.com/HumanSignal/label-studio-ml-backend) with a legacy API token.

You can now use personal access tokens as well.

#### Additional functional and usability enhancements

- There is a new option to select between the default column display and a more compact version.

- Updated UI on the Cloud Storages page when storage has not yet been set up.

- Added user session IDs to activity logs.

- Added a `none` option for the `decoder` param for Audio tags, which will allow you to skip audio decoding for use cases that require labeling on the timeline but the file size is far too large to decode at one time.

Improved permission checks when retrieving projects.
