          Context:
          - Repo: Humansignal/label-studio
          - PR Number: ${{ inputs.pr_number }}
          - PR Head SHA: ${{ inputs.head_sha }}
          - PR Base SHA: ${{ inputs.base_sha }}

          Objectives:
          1) Re-check existing review comments and reply resolved when addressed
          2) Review the current PR diff and flag only clear, high-severity issues
          3) Review only database migrations scripts under label_studio/*/migrations/ directory
          4) Do not comment on style, formatting, or nitpick issues
          5) Leave very short inline comments (1-2 sentences) on changed lines

          Procedure:
          - Get existing comments: gh pr view --json comments
          - Get diff: gh pr diff
          - Avoid duplicates: skip if similar feedback already exists on or near the same lines

          Commenting rules:
          - Max 10 inline comments total; prioritize the most critical issues
          - One issue per comment; place on the exact changed line
          - Natural tone, specific and actionable; do not mention automated or high-confidence
          - Use emojis: 🚨 Critical 🔒 Security ⚡ Performance ⚠️ Logic ✅ Resolved ✨ Improvement

          Submission:

          - Review right side of the PR diff viewer only
          - Use only: gh pr review --comment
          - Do not use: gh pr review --approve or --request-changes"
